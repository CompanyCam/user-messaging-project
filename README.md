## User Messaging - Applicant Project

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the CompanyCam applicant project. The goal of this project is to see how you organize code while simplifying a messy class.

### Overview

This app should send the provided message to a given user. The user should receive one message via each enabled `delivery_method`.

### Notes

Don't worry about making it _actually_ deliver a message, outputting the result to the console is fine. As it says above, this is to see how to refactor and organize code.

### Goals

Your goal is to modify the `users/message_delivery_service.rb` to make the specs green. You shouldn't need to modify the specs.

### Setup

- You will want a newish version of Ruby (> 2.4)
- `bundle`

### Running Specs

`bundle exec rspec`
